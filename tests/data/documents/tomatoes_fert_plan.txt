Test Fertilization Plan for Tomatoes

Seedling stage (Days 7â€“21):
Apply StartoGro A with an NPK ratio of 3-5-5 once per week at a dose of 5 ml per liter of water. This helps to stimulate early root development and reduce transplant shock.

Post-transplant rooting:
Use RootForce B (2-10-5) once immediately after transplanting. Apply 10 ml per plant directly into the soil around the root zone.

Vegetative growth (Pre-flowering):
Feed with GreenBlaster 21 (10-6-7) every 5 days, using 15 ml per liter. This promotes strong leaf and stem growth before flowering begins.

Pre-flowering phase:
Introduce PhosKick Plus (5-15-8) once weekly at a concentration of 20 ml per liter. It supports bud formation and the transition into reproductive growth.

Flowering period:
Use BloomStar X (4-12-12) twice a week. Apply at 10 ml per liter to support abundant and even flowering.

Fruiting phase:
Switch to FruitMax Ultra (8-10-15) every 4 days at 25 ml per liter. This helps the plant build fruit mass and maintain nutrient balance during high demand.

Late fruiting and ripening:
Apply K+ Finish Control (3-5-20) once weekly at 15 ml per liter. High potassium levels help improve fruit sweetness and ripening speed.

Stress situations (optional):
If the plant shows signs of leaf spotting or general stress (e.g., after heatwaves), apply AntiStress Zn-Mg, a foliar spray with zinc and magnesium, at 1 ml per liter of water. Use only as needed.
